# CSS-Flexbox-Grid
This is a website I made for a fictitious university.
My goal was to create a responsive website, so I started building the website with the "mobile-first" method and afterwards 
I used media queries to adapt the screen width to desktop users.
I created a logic with css and html to create a hamburguer menu.
I created University's favicon ( logo ) using Illustrator.
